# Machine Learning Lab - Practical Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of 12 Machine Learning practicals, ranging from fundamental library implementations to advanced classification and clustering algorithms. Each notebook includes code, explanations, and visualizations.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### **Phase 1: Foundations & Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. **NumPy Implementation**: Basics of array manipulation, mathematical operations, and linear algebra using the NumPy library.
2. **Pandas Implementation**: Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using DataFrames and Series.
3. **Univariate EDA**: Analyzing a single variable to summarize its main characteristics and find patterns.
4. **Multivariate EDA**: Exploring relationships between multiple variables using heatmaps, scatter plots, and pair plots.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.

### **Phase 2: Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)**

6. **Linear Regression**: Implementation of simple linear regression to predict continuous values (e.g., Salary prediction based on experience).
7. **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification using the Logistic function, applied to the Social Network Ads dataset.
8. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implementation of probabilistic classification based on Bayes' Theorem using the Iris dataset.
9. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classification based on feature similarity and distance metrics.

### **Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction**

10. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Using Principal Component Analysis to reduce feature space while retaining variance.
11. **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised grouping of data points into clusters based on centroid distances.

### **Phase 4: Capstone**

12. **Mini-Capstone Project**: A complete end-to-end pipeline for **Diabetes Prediction**, including preprocessing, modeling, and performance evaluation.
